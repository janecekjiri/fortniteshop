# Fortnite Shop
<b>What is Fortnite Shop?</b><p>
Fortnite Shop is an app which displays items which are currently in Fortnite's in-game item shop and are therefore available for purchase. 
Users can learn more about each cosmetic, for instance how many Vbucks (currency in Fortnite) does it cost or how often does it appear in the shop. Users may also see full-sized image of each cosmetic.<p>
Besides displaying content of Item Shop, users can also search for a specific cosmetic, see all cosmetics or just the ones which they want, based on either rarity or item type.<p>
<b>Goal of this app</b><p>
This app was created for 2 simple purposes. The first one is to simply allow Fortnite fans to check the daily item shop on their phones without having to deal with annoying adverts.<p>
The second one is to showcase my current iOS development abilities, to show how I work and to show what I can (and cannot) do.<p>
<b>Technical information</b><p>
This app was created for iPhones with iOS 13.2 and newer using Swift 5. 
It was created without using any (3rd-party) pods or libraries with the exception of SwiftLint which was used to help me to follow good coding practices. I used Ray Wenderlich's SwiftLint configuration.
The API used was provided by FortniteApi.io. Many thanks to them!<p>
<b>What is Fortnite?</b><p>
Fortnite is an online video game released by Epic Games which consists of 3 main modes: <i>Save the World</i>, <i>Battle Royale</i> and <i>Creative</i>. 
This app solely focuses on content related to <i>Battle Royale</i> mode.<p>
<b>What is Fortnite: Battle Royale?</b><p>
Fortnite Battle Royale is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (consisting of four players). 
Weaponless players airdrop from a "Battle Bus" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. 
Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. 
This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.<p>
